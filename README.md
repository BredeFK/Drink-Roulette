Add your preferred beverage to the app, and press `Generate` and you will have to take a shot of the displayed beverage.

**OBS: Always drink responsible :trollface:**

## Special thanks
The concept: [runlan95](https://github.com/runlan95)/[runala](https://github.com/runala):neckbeard:

## TODO for later
* Add barcode scanner for adding drinks later
* Add list of all drinks
* Add sound (or any indication) for when a new drink is generated
